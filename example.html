         <h3 class="section-heading">Self-Guided Walking Tours</h3>
         <p>Let’s be honest, everyone loves something free, right? I know I do! So self-guided walking tours are definitely the way forward. Not only can you maximise your time and see all the sights personalised to you. It is also the safest way to sightsee right now, thanks to coronavirus! You also won’t have to worry about the excess carbohydrate intake from all the delicious pizza and pasta dishes you will be eating as this way of exploration will keep you fit. It is personally my favourite way to adventure and I could not recommend it enough to other travellers.</p>
         <p>
           Bring your headphones and download the app ‘Rick Steves Audio Europe’ for greater information on the areas you love. It offers free audioguide access boasting general culture and sights. It aids less touristy exploration and allows you to become more immersed in the local way of life. For example, ‘ Milan’s Duomo Neighbourhood’.
         </p>
         <p>
           Below are two tours that support the most important sectors of Milan – Sights and fashion! It is possible to complete both tours in a day, or you may favour one over the other. If you like to take things slow 48 hours is perfect. Enjoy!

             Milan is a super compact city compared to others like Rome and Naples where you could be walking all day and still not cover a minuscule amount of what they have to offer. The true city centre of Milan spans less than 3 km so walking will not be a problem. It is typically the business capital of Italy and most locals would consider it a place of work and prefer to escape Milan when possible. This may suggest it is not a typical must see of Italy, but I would definitely recommend to give it a go. I think people either love it or they don’t...
           </p>
         <div class="tour-stop">
         <h3>Duomo di Milano</h3>
         <p>
           The Gothic Duomo of Milan dominates the Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral Square) and tells a story of faith and art. The square marks the centre of the city and is highly important regarding art, culture and social aspects of Italy. It includes some of the most important buildings of Milan, such as the Royal Palace and Milan Cathedral. It is also where the most prestigious commercial activities take place. It originated in the 14th century and has gradually developed ever since, making it the greatest tourist attraction of the city.
         </p>
         <p>
           The construction of Milan cathedral began in 1386 and took nearly six centuries to complete. Final details were accomplished in 1965 and has been dedicated to Saint Mary Nascent. The church is the largest in Italy, the second-largest in Europe and the fourth-largest in the world, so you can only imagine the beauty of this building. You can climb the 201 stairs/70 metres to reach the rooftop and take a closer look at the intricate details of the spires, myriads of statues, as well as being rewarded by the breathtaking panorama view at the top. Don’t worry, if you want to take a shortcut or are limited with time you can also take a lift to the top.
         </p>
         <p>
           The standard entry ticket (culture pass) costs <em class="price">€10.50</em> per person and includes entrance to the cathedral, archaeological area, duomo museum, the church of San Gottardo and exhibitions.

         <h3>Palazzo Reale di Milano (Royal Palace of Milan)</h3>
         <p>
           The Royal Palace of Milan is situated next to the Duomo Cathedral and is one of the most important art and cultural centres of the city. Today it displays contemporary and modern art exhibitions from international famous collections in the form of paintings, sculptures, photography and video art.
         </p>
         <p>
           The Palace was formerly called ‘Palazzo del Broletto Vecchio’ and was the seat of the government and royal residence until 1919. Unfortunately, it has been heavily damaged and reconstructed several times since it was originally built so does not display its authentic magnificence. Towards the end of the 18th century, the Palace was renovated in Neoclassical style by the architect Giuseppe Piermarini (who also designed Milan’s La Scala Theatre). During world war II in 1943, the Royal Palace of Milan was heavily bombed and remained abandoned. It wasn’t until the 21st century, almost fifty years after its destruction, new restoration projects took place to restore its beauty. The purpose of such project was to create the Palace Museum as it is today to present the four historical eras the Palace lived through - the Neoclassical era, Napoleon's period, the Restoration and the Unification of Italy.
         </p>
         <p>
           The palace has been restored to its original 18th century decor in the same glory. The main highlights include the Court Theatre, the Room of the Ambassadors, the Great Captain's Room, Flemish Hall, Hercules Hall, the Palatine Chapel and the Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele II (and the largest library in southern Italy).
         </p>

         </p>
         <p>
          <b>TIP</b> – If you are on a budget you do not need to enter unless art exhibitions are your thing then it is totally worth it. You can still gaze at its remarkable historical presence from the outside.

         <h3>Chiesa di San Gottardo In Corte</h3>
         <p>
           The church was built by Azzone Visconti in 1330 and took only six year to complete. It was originally blessed to the Virgin Mary until Azzone Visconti suffered from gout, thus is now dedicated to San Gottardo, the patron saint of gout and gall.
         </p>
         <p>
           The most striking feature is the Lombard Gothic bell tower famous for being Milan’s first example of the public clock (before sun-dials) and marks the first hour after sunset. The octagonal tower has since kept its original appearance but the interior has been completely remodeled in the neoclasicist era by Giocondo Albertolli.
         </p>
         <p>
           Highlights include the the tomb of Azzone Visconti, the painting San Carlo Borromeo in Gloria, a 14th century fresco of the Cruxifixion, and the 20th century stained glass murals.
         </p>
         <p>
           Entrance fee is included within the culture pass for Milan Cathedral and is recommended to use the official ‘Duomo di Milano’ app. A single entrance fee is also possible costing a standard <em class="price">€5</em> or <em class="price">€2</em> for a reduced ticket (also includes entrance to the Duomo Museum).

         <h3>Santa Maria presso San Satiro (Church of Saint Mary near Saint Satyrus)</h3>
         <p>
           This church dates back to the 9th century and lies the site of worship erected by the archbishop Anspertus. Since 1476 the Italian Renaissance structure houses the medieval shrine to Saint Satyrus, confessor and brother of Saints Ambrose and Marcellina.
         </p>
         <p>
           Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza of Milan commissioned a new church for his city. His ambitions were greater than the tiny location on a busy street that was presented to him. It took a special architect and painter to form such a wonder, Donato Bramante . He created a church with an astonishing act of visual deception, implementing a solution by painting an architectural optical illusion. It was small on the outside and visualised large on the inside – some may compare to the Tardis.
         </p>
         <p>
           If you stand at the entrance of the church you will have the impression of a much larger space giving the illusion of the altar far behind than is physically possible. Special lighting inside the church also aided this special effect. However, the magical illusion soon disappears when you step aside from the main entrance.

         <h3>Piazza Mercanti (Merchants Square)</h3>
         <p>
           Piazza Mercanti is central public square located in the heart of the ancient city between Piazza del Duomo and Piazza Cordusio. It is an architectural medieval treasure trove with four distinct buildings which have stood since they were erected:
         </p>
         <ul class="body-list">
           <li>The 13th-century Broletto Nuovo (Palazzo della Ragione)</li>
           <li>The 15th century Gothic Palazzo dei Notai (“Notary’s Palace”)</li>
           <li>The 17th century Baroque Palazzo delle Scuole Palantine</li>
           <li>The 14th century Logio degli Osii, where city officials used to address the public</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
           A myriad of statues and other monuments are also present, built by Giovan Pietro Lasagna and Luigi Scorzini. The historic medieval architecture is what will attract you to this picturesque square.
         </p>

       <div class="tour-stop">
         <h3>Teatro La Scala (Opera House and Museum)</h3>
         <p>
           A world-renowned opera house built in 1778 and became a prominent meeting place for the noble and wealthy. It is regarded as one of the leading opera and ballet theatres in the world and has witnessed the performance of Italy’s greatest operatic artists. La Scala Orchestra, made-up of 135 musicians, is also considered one of the world’s best for opera productions and attain an impressive international position for its symphony. The theatre is currently one of the richest and most envied collections so you will surely love your visit here.
         </p>
         <p>
           Originally spectators would watch the show standing up while being illuminated by thousands of oil lamps. Oil lamps were then replaced with gas lamps, followed by electric lights in 1883. Further renovations took place in 1907 providing its current layout with nearly 2,000 seats. However , as you would suspect, it was heavily bombed in world war II and has since had major renovations.
         </p>
         <p>
           The outside of the building is considered rather plain compared to the theatre’s exquisite architecture inside. You can either watch a show, partake in a tour or visit the attached museum to get a feel of this wonder. I would also recommend taking a break to relax in the Piazza della Scala.

         <h3>Castello Sforzesco (Sforzesco Castle)</h3>
         <p>
           Sforzesco Castle was originally built in the 15th centurt by Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, on the remnants of a 14th century fortification. However, has been destroyed and restored several times since. Across centuries, the castle has survived numerous battles, occupations and destructions. For example, Napoleon causes severe damage to the external structure of the old fortress and used the quarters for troops. In 1905 it was finally given back to the city of Milan and became a major epicentre for art and culture.
         </p>
         <p>
           The fortress was extensively renovated and re-modelled by Luca Beltrami and now houses seven distinct fine art museums open to the general public, including, the Museum of Antique Art, the Museum of Musical Instruments, and of the Picture Gallery. It is also home to Michelangelo’s unfinished work “Rondanini Pieta” and many of Leonardo da vinci’s intricately detailed ceiling paintings. Each room is a artistic treasure boasting exhibitions, monuments, sculptures and ceiling art. The interior is absolutely beautiful and one for all the art folks.
         </p>
         <p>
           <b>But</b> spending your time admiring the castle courtyards, gardens and outer architecture are also well worth your time.

         <h3>Santa Marie delle Grazie (Church of Saint Mary)</h3>
         <p>
           Of all churches in Milan, the Church of Saint Mary is most inspiring. It is a UNESCO world heritage site built in Gothic and Renaissance styles between 1466 and 1490.
         </p>
         <p>
           It contains the mural of “The Last Supper” by Leonardo da Vinci which was painted between 1493 and 1497. Instead of using fresco, the normal Renaissance technique for wall paintings, Leonardo used tempera which gave him the greatest freedom for alterations. However, the medium began to deteriorate after 20 years so has undergone numerous attempts in restorations to preserve it. Luckily it still stands today.
         </p>
         <p>
           Much of the church was destroyed during world war II, only some of the walls survived, including the one that holds The Last Supper and has since been restored and renovated to protect it.
         </p>
         <p>
           Entrance ticket costs <em class="price">€25</em> for a standard, <em class="price">€12</em> for a reduced ticket (18-25 years) and <em class="price">free</em> for individuals under the age of 18. This also includes an audioguides. I would advise to book online to avoid as tickets sell out quickly.

           <h4 class="section-heading">Typical Budget</h4>
           <p>Living comfortably on a backpacker’s budget, expect to spent approximately <em class="price">£50</em> (€56) per person, per day. This takes into consideration accomodation, food/drink, public transport and entrance fees. Keep in mind this is just an average, some days you may spend more, some days you may spend less. Everyone is different!</p>
           <p>Accommodation and food will always be the most important (and expensive) part of budgeting. Alcohol is also pricey, so try to keep that minimal if possible.</p>

           <p>Here are a few points that might appeal to you and aid the cut in costs of your trip. Milan is considered expensive so I hope they help!</p>
             <ul class="tips-list">
             <li><p>Book accommodation out of the city centre – Milan has great public transport links.</p></li>
             <li><p>Book accommodation that includes breakfast.</p></li>
             <li><p>Avoid public transport (especially taxi’s) in the city centre as everywhere is within walking distance.</p></li>
             <li><p>Take a reusable bottle as there are water fountains everywhere.</p></li>
             <li><p>Eat larger meals at lunch and a smaller meal in the evenings – they are the same size but cheaper!</p></li>
             <li><p>Buy your breakfasts and/or lunches from a local supermarket.</p></li>
             <li><p>Look out for lunch deals – for example, there are some near Duomo Cathedral that offer a drink and pizza or pasta for €12.</p></li>
             <li><p>Branch out and avoid eating near the Cathedral as that is where the most expensive restaurants are situated.</p></li>
             <li><p>If you are looking for cheap cocktails, visit Naviglio canal where they are on offer for €5 each.</p></li>
             <li><p>Also along Naviglio canal, there are ‘happy hour’ deals which offer a cocktail and unlimited buffet for €10-12.</p></li>
           <li><p>Get a city pass, for example €11 for one day – offers free public transport, free or discounted entry to top attractions and so much more.</p></li>
           <li><p>Look out for reduced prices in to top attractions – for example, this may include students or 18-25 year olds.</p></li>
