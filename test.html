      <h3>Self-Guided Walking Tours</h3>
      <p>Let’s be honest, everyone loves something free, right? I know I do! So self-guided walking tours are definitely the way forward. Not only can you maximise your time and see all the sights personalised to you. It is also the safest way to sightsee right now, thanks to coronavirus! You also won’t have to worry about the excess carbohydrate intake from all the delicious pizza and pasta dishes you will be eating as this way of exploration will keep you fit. It is personally my favourite way to adventure and I could not recommend it enough to other travellers.</p>
      <p>
        Bring your headphones and download the app ‘Rick Steves Audio Europe’ for greater information on the areas you love. It offers free audioguide access boasting general culture and sights. It aids less touristy exploration and allows you to become more immersed in the local way of life. For example, ‘ Milan’s Duomo Neighborhood’.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are two tours that support the most important sectors of Milan – Sights and fashion! It is possible to complete both tours in a day, or you may favour one over the other. If you like to take things slow 48 hours is perfect. Enjoy!

          Milan is a super compact city compared to others like Rome and Naples where you could be walking all day and still not cover a miniscule amount of what they have to offer. The true city centre of Milan spans less than 3 km so walking will not be a problem. It is typically the business capital of Italy and most locals would consider it a place of work and prefer to excape Milan when possible. This may suggest it is not a typical must see of Italy, but I would definitely recommend to give it a go. I think people either love it or they don’t...
        </p>

    <div class="tour-stop">
      <h3>Duomo di Milano</h3>
      <p>
        The Gothic Duomo of Milan dominates the Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral Square) and tells a story of faith and art. The squarte marks the centre of the city and is highly important regarding art, culture and social aspects of Italy. It includes some of the most important buildings of Milan, such as the Royal Palace and Milan Cathedral. It is also where the most prestigious commercial activities take place. It originated in the 14th century and has gradually developed ever since, making it the greatest tourist attraction of the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        The construction of Milan cathedral began in 1386 and took nearly six centuries to complete. Final details were accomplished in 1965 and has been dedicated to Saint Mary Nascent. The church is the largest in Italy, the second-largest in Europe and the fourth-largest in the world, so you can only imagine the beauty of this building. You can climb the 201 stairs/70 metres to reach the rooftop and take a closer look at the intricate details of the spires, myriads of statues, as well as being rewarded by the breathtaking panorama view at the top. Don’t worry, if you want to take a shortcut or are limited with time you can also take a lift to the top.
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard entry ticket (culture pass) costs €10.50 per person and includes entrance to the cathedral, archaeological area, duomo museum, the church of San Gottardo and exhibitions. Reduced tickets are also available for children, students and senior citizens at €4. If you wish to climb to the rooftop it is €15 for standard entry and €7 for a reduced ticket. Fast track options and guided tours also available at an extra cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buy tickets online at <b>https://www.duomomilano.it/en/buy-tickets/</b>to avoid dissapointment.
      </p>
      <p>
        TIP – If you are on a budget and avoid entrance you will still not be dissapointed by the outstanding view from the outside of the Cathedral. The size and intricate prints are something I will never forget.

      <h3>Palazzo Reale di Milano (Royal Palace of Milan)</h3>
      <p>
        The Royal Palace of Milan is situated next to the Duomo Cathedral and is one of the most important art and cultural centres of the city. Today it displays contemporary and modern art exhibitions from international famous collections in the form of paintings, sculptures, photography and video art.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Palace was formerly called ‘Palazzo del Broletto Vecchio’ and was the seat of the government and royal residence until 1919. Unfortunately, it has been heavily damaged and recostructed several times since it was originally built so does not display its authentic magnificence. Towards the end of the 18th century, the Palace was renovated in Neoclassical style by the architect Giuseppe Piermarini (who also designed Milan’s La Scala Theatre). During world war II in 1943, the Royal Palace of Milan was heavily bombed and remained abandoned. It wasn’t until the 21st century, almost fifty years after its destruction, new restoration projects took place to restore its beauty. The purpose of such project was to create the Palace Museum as it is today to present the four historical eras the Palace lived through - the Neoclassical era, Napoleon's period, the Restoration and the Unification of Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The palace has been restored to its original 18th century decor in the same glory. The main highlights include the Court Theatre, the Room of the Ambassadors, the Great Captain's Room, Flemish Hall, Hercules Hall, the Palatine Chapel and the Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele II (and the largest library in southern Italy).
      </p>
      <p>
        Book online at <b>https://www.palazzorealemilano.it/en</b>to avoid queues and fast track your visit. Standard entrance fee costs € 14 and € 12 for a reduced ticket.
      </p>
      <p>
       TIP – If you are on a budget you do not need to enter unless art exhibitions are your thing then it is totally worth it. You can still gaze at its remarkable historical presence from the outside.

      <h3>Chiesa di San Gottardo In Corte</h3>
      <p>
        The church was built by Azzone Visconti in 1330 and took only six year to complete. It was originially blessed to the Virgin Mary until Azzone Visconti suffered from gout, thus is now dedicated to San Gottardo, the patron saint of gout and gall.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most striking feature is the Lombard Gothic bell tower famous for being Milan’s first example of the public clock (before sun-dials) and marks the first hour after sunset. The octagonal tower has since kept its original appearance but the interior has been completely remodeled in the neoclasicist era by Giocondo Albertolli.
      </p>
      <p>
        Highlights include the the tomb of Azzone Visconti, the painting San Carlo Borromeo in Gloria, a 14th century fresco of the Cruxifixion, and the 20th century stained glass murals.
      </p>

      <h3>Santa Maria presso San Satiro (Church of Saint Mary near Saint Satyrus)</h3>
      <p>
        This church dates back to the 9th century and lies the site of worship erected by the archbishop Anspertus. Since 1476 the Italian Renaissance structure houses the medieval shrine to Saint Satyrus, confessor and brother of Saints Ambrose and Marcellina.
      </p>
      <p>
        Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza of Milan commissioned a new church for his city. His ambitions were greater than the tiny location on a busy street that was presented to him. It took a special architect and painter to form such a wonder, Donato Bramante . He created a church with an astonishing act of visual deception, implenting a solution by painting an architectural optical illusion. It was small on the outside and visualised large on the inside – some may compare to the tardis.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you stand at the entrance of the church you will have the impression of a much larger space giving the illusion of the altar far behind than is physically possible. Special lighting inside the church also aided this special effect. However, the magicial illusion soon disappears when you step aside from the main entrance.

      <h3>Piazza Mercanti (Merchants Square)</h3>
      <p>
        Piazza Mercanti is central public square located in the heart of the ancient city between Piazza del Duomo and Piazza Cordusio. It is an architectural medieval treasure trove with four distinct buildings which have stood since they were erected:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The 13th-century Broletto Nuovo (Palazzo della Ragione)</li>
        <li>The 15th century Gothic Palazzo dei Notai (“Notary’s Palace”)</li>
        <li>The 17th century Baroque Palazzo delle Scuole Palantine</li>
        <li>The 14th century Logio degli Osii, where city officials used to address the public</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A myriad of statues and other monuments are also present, built by Giovan Pietro Lasagna and Luigi Scorzini. The historic medieval architecture is what will attract you to this picturesque square.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="tour-stop">
      <h3>Teatro La Scala (Opera House and Museum)</h3>
      <p>
        A world-renowned opera house built in 1778 and became a prominent meeting place for the noble and wealthy. It is regarded as one of the leading opera and ballet thatres in the world and has witnessed the performance of Italy’s greatest operatic artists. La Scala Orchestra, made-up of 135 musicians, is also considered one of the world’s best for opera productions and attain an impressive international position for its symphony. The theatre is currecntly one of the richest and most envied collections so you will surely love your visit here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally spectators would watch the show standing up while being illuminated by thousands of oil lamps. Oil lamps were then replaced with gas lamps, followed by electric lights in 1883. Further renovations took place in 1907 providing its current layout with nearly 2,000 seats. However , as you would suspect, it was heavily bombed in world war II and has since had major renovations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The outside of the building is considered rather plain compared to the theatre’s exquisite architecture inside. You can either watch a show, partake in a tour or visit the attached museum to get a feel of this wonder. I would also recommend taking a break to relax in the Piazza della Scala.

      <h3>Castello Sforzesco (Sforzesco Castle)</h3>
      <p>
        Sforzesco Castle was originally built in the 15th centurt by Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, on the remnants of a 14th centrut fortification. However, has been destroyed and restored several times since. Across centuries, the castle has survived numerous battles, occupations and destructions. For example, Nepoleon causes sevre damage to the external structure of the old fortress and used the quarters for troops. In 1905 it was finally given back to the city of Milan and bacame a major epicentre for art and culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fortress was extrensively renovated and re-modelled by Luca Beltrami and now houses seven distinct fine art museums open to the general piblic, including, the Museum of Antique Art, the Museum of Musical Instruments, and of the Picture Gallery. It is also home to Michelangelo’s unfished work “Rondanini Pieta” and many of Leonardo da vinci’s intricatlet detailed ceiling paintings. Each room is a artistic treasure boasting exhibitions, monuments, sculptures and ceiling art. The interior is absolutely beautiful and one for all the art folks.
      </p>

      <h3>Santa Marie delle Grazie (Church of Saint Mary)</h3>
      <p>
        Of all churches in Milan, the Church of Saint Mary is most inspiring. It is a UNESCO world heritage site built in Gothic and Renaissance styles between 1466 and 1490.
      </p>
      <p>
        It contains the mural of “The Last Supper” by Leonardo da Vinci which was painted between 1493 and 1497. Instead of using fresco, the normal Renaissance technique for wall paintings, Leondard used tempera which gave him the greatest freedom for alterations. However, the medium began to deteriorate after 20 years so has undergone numerous attempts in restorations to preserve it. Luckily it still stands today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of the church was destroyed during world war II, only some of the walls survived, including the one that holds The Last Supper and has since been restored and renovated to protect it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entrance for a standard ticket costs <b>€25</b>, <b>€12</b> for a reduced ticket (18-25 years) and free for individuals under the age of 18. This also includes an audioguides. I would advise to book online to avoid as tickets sell out quickly.
